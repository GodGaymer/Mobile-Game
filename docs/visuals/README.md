# ForgeBelt Guild Visual Starter Pack (Portrait)

This package turns the one-page design doc into production-ready visual references for first-pass UI/UX and art direction.

## Deliverables

1. `shift-screen-wireframe.md` — portrait gameplay wireframe with layout zones and state notes.
2. `style-guide.md` — color, typography, iconography, and effects direction.
3. `figma-build-spec.md` — frame setup, component map, and naming conventions for immediate Figma build-out.
4. `assets/icon-checklist.md` — MVP icon list with semantic states.

## Intended Use

- **Design:** Use as the baseline for high-fidelity mockups.
- **Engineering:** Use as UI contract for HUD behavior and affordances.
- **Production:** Use for sprint scoping and visual QA acceptance criteria.

## Scope for this pass

- Portrait-first mobile UX.
- 3–7 minute shift readability.
- Thumb-friendly controls and high-alert clarity.
- No final art polish; focuses on structure, legibility, and interaction state coverage.
